## Milestone 1
Supports update, select, delete, and sum.

Rather unclean. Too much repetitive code. Documentation style is also fairly inconsistent. Readability suffers at certain points. This can be fixed by wrapping functions around frequently repeated operations.

Maintains a hash-table based index over the key column specified when creating the table. There is currently no support for creating multiple indexes over multiple columns. For this milestone, only one index is maintained at a time. The index can, however, be indexed over a column with duplicate values (i.e. not all key values have to be unique).

test script should be located in the same directory as the source code (just like tester.py). db.py should be imported using 'from db import Database', and query.py should be imported using 'from query import Query'.
